In this exercise the goal was to make a clone Amazon product page,
Including some basic functionality in javascript ( cart number change with buttons, carousel is dynamic)
I tried to make the carousel in the bottom of the page to be dynamic and adjusting to screen size.
I also built a paginator function that divide the database into pages,base on the database size and screen size,
