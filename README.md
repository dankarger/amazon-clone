##  Practicing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
### Part of "AppleSeed" FullStack BootCamp

- In this exercise the goal was to make a clone of an Amazon product page including some basic functionality in javascript ( cart number changing with the buttons, carousel is working etc)
- I tried to make the carousel in the bottom of the page to be dynamic and adjusting to screen size.
- I also made a paginator function that divide the database into pages, based on the database size and number of items per page variable (which is changing based on the screen width).
